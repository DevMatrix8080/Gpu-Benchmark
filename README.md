# 🚀 GPU Benchmark (WebGL)

A simple web-based GPU benchmark tool that runs directly in your browser using WebGL. This project allows you to quickly estimate your GPU's performance by rendering a large number of triangles and measuring the frame rate (FPS). 🎮💻

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, etc.).
3. Click the **"Start Benchmark"** button to start the test.
4. View the FPS and other statistics displayed on the page.

## 💡 Compatibility

- Works on desktop PCs, laptops, and any device with a browser that supports HTML5 and WebGL.
- Performance results may vary depending on your operating system, browser, and hardware specifications.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

- This tool provides only a rough estimation of your GPU's capabilities.
- For more accurate and reliable results, it is recommended to use dedicated GPU benchmarking software such as 3DMark, Unigine Heaven, or other professional tools. 🏆

## 📝 Notes

- The benchmark does not stress the GPU as much as professional tools and does not account for all hardware/software variables.
- Ideal for quick and informal comparisons between devices.
